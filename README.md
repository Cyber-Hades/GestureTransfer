# ✋ Gesture Transfer  

Seamless **gesture-based file and message transfer** within the same local network (LAN).  
This project combines **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** with **socket programming** to enable contactless sharing using **hand gestures**.

## 📖 Description  
**Gesture Transfer** is a prototype system that allows you to **send files and messages** across devices on the **same network (LAN)** using hand gestures as triggers.  
It showcases how **gesture recognition (via OpenCV + Mediapipe)** can integrate with **network communication (sockets)** to deliver a unique **contactless file transfer experience**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (core language)  
- **OpenCV** (gesture recognition)  
- **Mediapipe** (hand tracking)  
- **Socket Programming** (LAN communication)  

---

## ⚡ Features  
- ✋ Trigger transfers with hand gestures  
- 📡 Real-time socket communication over LAN  
- ⚡ Lightweight & internet-free (works on same network)  
- 🔒 Configurable IP and Port  
- 💻 Cross-platform prototype  

---

## 🚀 Setup & Usage  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gesture-transfer.git
cd gesture-transfer
````

### 2️⃣ Configure IP & Port

Edit the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "this_device_ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "peer_device_ip": "192.168.1.20",
  "port": 9999
}
```

* `this_device_ip`: Your own device’s LAN IP
* `peer_device_ip`: Target device’s LAN IP
* `port`: Any free port (default: 9999)

*(Tip: Use `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Linux/Mac to find your IP)*

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the project

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

* 📂 Contactless file sharing in labs, classrooms, or offices
* 🖐️ Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) experiments
* 🎓 Academic demo of networking + gesture recognition integration

## 🙌 Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to **fork, open issues, or submit pull requests** to enhance features like:

* Adding more gestures
* Supporting different transfer modes
* Improving UI/UX

👉 This README is **copy-paste ready**.  

Do you also want me to generate a **`requirements.txt`** file for you (with OpenCV, Mediapipe, etc.) so that the setup instructions are 100% runnable?
